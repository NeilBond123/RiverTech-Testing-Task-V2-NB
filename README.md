# RiverTech Testing Task V2 NB
 Revised task with the same API and Selenium tests used previously. 
 
 Implemented an XUnit approach instead of the previous NUnit implementation due to XUnit being a more recent and allows for isolated testing due to the ability of running tests independently of each other.

 Project created using Visual Studio 2022's XUnit template, with LightBDD's XUnit library used for unit tests and Page Object model implemented for Selenium tests.
