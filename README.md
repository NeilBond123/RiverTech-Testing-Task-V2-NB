# RiverTech Testing Task V2 NB
Revised task with the same API and Selenium tests used previously. 
 
Implemented an XUnit approach instead of the previous NUnit implementation due to XUnit being more extensive, minimizes the need for complex setup, has more straightforward syntax and allows for parallel testing.

Project created using Visual Studio 2022's XUnit template, with LightBDD's XUnit library used for unit tests and Page Object model implemented for Selenium tests.

# To run tests
Tests can be run within Visual Studio using the Test Explorer.

# Required NuGet packages
